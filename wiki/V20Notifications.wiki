#summary Summarizes info about notifications

== Notification ==

Notification is used to let all plugins know about changes that some plugin made.

== Sending notification ==

To send notification you need to call:

`void ILmsService.Inform(string evt, params object[] data);`

`string evt` - string describing event that happened.

`params object[] data` - arguments sent with notification.
e.g.:
`ILmsService.Inform("course/delete", course);`

== Handling message ==

Each plugin has method to handle notifications:

`void IPlugin.Update(string evt, params object[] data);`

Example of handling a notification:
{{{
if (evt == "course/delete")
{
  var course = (Course)data[0]
  var roles = Storage.GetRoles(course);
  Storage.Remove(roles);
}
}}}
