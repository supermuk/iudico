# Controllers in Plugins must inherit from *PluginController* because it overrides *View()* method, which searches for view in plugin assembly. Also, *PluginController* has *lmsService* property, which allows using API by accessing services registered with LMS. 
# Services has to be registered in *Install* method from *IWindsorInstaller* interface using the following syntax:
Component.For`<`_ISpecificService_>().ImplementedBy`<`_ServiceClassName_>().LifeStyle.Is(Castle.Core.LifestyleType.Singleton)
