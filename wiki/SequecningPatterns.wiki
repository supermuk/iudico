== Sequecning Patterns Details ==

|| # || Strategy Name || Nodes' type criterion || Description ||
|| 1 || Organization Default Sequencing || Organization || Is applied to Organization just created. Any sub activity may be experienced any moment of time any number of times. If Organization is attempted – selection flows to the first child activity. ||
|| 2 || Chapter Default Sequecning || Chapter ||Is applied to any Chapter activity just created. Any sub activity may be experienced at any moment of time any number of times. If Chapter is attempted– selection flows to the first child activity. ||
|| 3 || Control Chapter Default Sequencing || Control Chapter || Is applied to any Control Chapter just created. Student can attempt this chapter only once.  Sub activities (children) may be passed in straight forward-only order only.  Student can’t see other activities except current control chapter and it's sub activities. If Control Chapter is attempted– selection flows to the first child activity. ||
|| 4 || Forced Forward-only Order || Chapter, Control Chapter, Organization || Student can experience sub activities of current activity in continuous forward-only order. Student can’t step back. But still can skip current sub activity to experience next one. All sub activities should be attempted. If current activity is attempted– selection flows to the first child activity. ||
|| 5 || Forced Sequential Order || Chapter, Control Chapter, Organization || Student can experience next sub activity of current activity only after current sub activity’s objective was satisfied. Skipping sub activity is forbidden. Jumping over the next sub activity is forbidden too. But student still can experience already satisfied/completed sub activities.  If current activity is attempted– selection flows to the first child activity.||
|| 6 || Post Test || Organization, Chapter, Control Chapter. Last activity: Control chapter or Question ||Based on the Forced Sequential Order pattern. Score, completion and satisfaction evaluation of affected activity is based on the result of last Post Test.||
|| 7 || Pre-Test or Post-Test || Organization, Chapter, Control Chapter. Last  and first sub-activity: Control chapter or Question || Student is free to experience any sub-activity. If student passed pre-test, post-test is disabled. Pre-test may be attempted only once. If pre-test failed, post-test is enabled only if all other sub activities are completed/satisfied. Score, completion and satisfaction evaluation of affected activity is based on the result of Pre-test or Post-Test. ||
|| 8 || Random Post-Test || Organization, Chapter, Control Chapter. Last sub-activity: Control chapter || Student is free to experience any sub-activity. Post-test is available only after all other sub-activities are completed/satisfied. Score, completion and satisfaction evaluation of affected activity is based on the result of the Post-Test. Student has ability to try pass Post-test N times. Each time, test is selected randomly from a set of tests. After N unsuccessful tries exit from current affected activity happens. ||
|| 9 ||Remediation || Organization, Chapter, Control Chapter || Activities are located in pairs: asset (theory) & sco (question/test). Student progresses through all sub-activities consistently (continuously). Student may skip sub-activity. After all sub-activities are “visited”, learning progress starts from the beginning. If test is passed (satisfied) pair(theory and test) is skipped. Cycle loops until all tests are satisfied. ||
|| 10 ||Random Set of Tests || Organization or Control Chapter with All Examination Sub-Activities || Control Chapter Default sequencing is applied to the affected activity. Student progresses through the M activities, chosen randomly from a set of Question activities. ||
